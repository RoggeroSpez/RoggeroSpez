Hello and Welcome, My name is Roggero Spezialy, I just finished my Front-End Software Development BootCamp in late Novemeber of Twenty-Twenty-Three, I have learned how to implement the basics in Html5, CSS, JavaScript as well as React. I have several Projects on this account.
Most of the Projects are done through the school and a few are personally made to help me learn on my own. I am aiming to be a Game Dev but I am always looking to learn more in the various other Languages avalible.
